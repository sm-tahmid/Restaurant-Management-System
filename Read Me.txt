# Restaurant Management System

## Introduction

The Restaurant Management System is a simple command-line application written in C that allows users to manage a restaurant's menu and perform basic operations like adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, generating a money slip, and confirming payment.


## Features

1. **Display Full Menu:** View the entire menu with item details such as ID, name, price, and stock availability.

2. **Add Item to Cart:** Select items from the menu and add them to the cart, specifying the desired quantity. The system checks for stock availability.

3. **Remove Item from Cart:** Remove items from the cart, adjusting the quantity. The system updates the menu stock accordingly.

4. **Generate Money Slip:** View a detailed money slip that includes the items in the cart, their prices, quantities, and the total amount.

5. **Confirm Payment from Cart:** Confirm the payment, clear the cart, and provide a thank-you message.

6. **Save and Load Data:** Save the menu and cart data to a file and load it at the start of the program. This ensures persistence between program executions.

7. **Clean Exit:** Save data before exiting the program. Displays a project credit message.
